    Hi everyone!
</h1>

I am developing this project with my colleague/friend ([Ilya Dementeev](https://github.com/elyasn0)). It was supposed to be a kind of casual game that we will develop in one weekend but, it's scary to admit, this project has already taken at least 3 months. But we will finish it!

The essence of the game is to shoot a ball into a basketball hoop, but using golf mechanics. Do you understand, Basket + Golf? <u><b>Basketgolf!</b></u>

In the test scene we also added a counter to avoid boredom:
* throws; 
* hits. 

Looks something like this:

<i>I know it's still too boring!</i>

In the future we plan to create more interesting levels and develop a small narrative. But for now, that's all for now!
